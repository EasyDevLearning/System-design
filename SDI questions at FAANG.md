# System Design Interview Questions at FAANG
As a software engineer, I know the ambition of landing a role at FAANG (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) or MAANG (including Microsoft). The goal of joining these companies may stem from various reasons, but for many, it is the cutting-edge technologies these companies work on to build large-scale distributed systems. They offer challenging and impactful projects, boosting career growth, global influence, and attractive compensation.

<br>Applying as a senior software engineer, I already knew that I had to go through the [system design interview](https://www.educative.io/blog/faang-system-design-interview-guide); a bit scary to know it is one of the toughest parts of the FAANG interview process. I’m sharing some common system design interview questions asked at each FAANG (including Microsoft).
