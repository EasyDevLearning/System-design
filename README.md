# System Design
System Design is a vital skill for engineers looking to build efficient, scalable systems—and it’s a must-have for anyone aiming
for top roles at leading tech companies. Preparing for these interviews can feel overwhelming, with questions that are open-ended
and require a deep understanding of how to structure complex systems. This repository is crafted to serve as your go-to resource
for preparing for system design interviews, offering a structured approach that covers essential topics, popular questions, and
focused resources.
## Why does System Design matter?
System Design tests your ability to architect solutions that are scalable, efficient, and maintainable—skills that are essential
for tackling real-world engineering challenges. Whether you’re aiming for FAANG roles or other top companies, a solid foundation
in system design helps you stand out and demonstrates your capability to design complex systems under real constraints.

## Hub-spoke model for preparation
I’ve used a hub-and-spoke model to keep this repository organized and easy to navigate. At the center is the System Design Interview, with branches that break down each key area for your study path—whether it’s honing in on common questions, understanding what FAANG companies look for, or accessing curated resources. Each section is crafted to help you focus on what matters most, making your prep time efficient and targeted.
